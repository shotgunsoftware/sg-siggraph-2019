[daemon]
# General daemon operational settings

# The pidFile is the location where the daemon will store its process id. If
# this file is removed while the daemon is running, it will shutdown cleanly
# after the next pass through the event processing loop.
pidFile: /var/run/shotgunEventDaemon.pid

# The eventIdFile is the location where the daemon will store the id of the last
# processed event. This will allow the daemon to pick up where it left off when
# last shutdown thus not missing any events. If you want to ignore any events
# since last daemon shutdown, remove this file before daemon startup and the
# daemon will process only new events created after startup.

# The logging mode to operate in:
# 0 = all log message in the main log file
# 1 = one main file for the engine, one file per plugin

# The level of logging that should be sent to the log file. This value is only
# applicable to for the main dispatching engine and can be overriden on a per
# plugin basis. This value is passed to the logging library. Any positive
# integer value is valid but most common cases are:
# - 10 - Debug
# - 20 - Info
# - 30 - Warnings
# - 40 - Error
# - 50 - Critical

# Enable Timing logging
# Timing logging is a separate log file that will log timing information regarding
# event dispatching and processing run time. This is to help diagnose which plugins
# are taking the most amount of time and where any potential queue processing
# delay might be coming from. Valid values are `on` or to enable or anything else
# to disable.

[emails]
# Email notification settings. These are used for error reporting because we

#
# Any error above level 40 (ERROR) will be reported via email.
#
# All of these value must be provided for there to be email alerts sent out.

# The server that should be used for smtp connections. The username and password
# values can be uncommented to supply credentials for the smtp connection. The
# smtp port can also be uncommented to supply an alternate port such as 587 for
# GMail TLS SMTP. As for the useTLS parameter, it is a True/False value.
